# Crystal
Crystal is an interference-resilient ultra-low power data collection protocol for wireless sensor networks (WSN) especially efficient in applications generating sparse aperiodic traffic. It was shown to achieve over 99.999% packet delivery rate in presence of Wi-Fi interference with per-mille radio duty cycle in some real-world applications. Crystal uses Glossy as underlying communication and time-synchronization primitive.

Crystal got the [2nd prize](https://iti-testbed.tugraz.at/blog/page/11/ewsn-18-dependability-competition-final-results/) at the EWSN'18 Dependability Competition!

## Status
Currently the protocol is implemented for the TMote Sky platform only. Porting it to more modern platforms is in our near future plans.
